# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the Guess the Number Game, a simple and interactive Python mini-project!

## Overview

Guess the Number is a classic game where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a specified range. This mini project is designed to help you practice Python basics, including variables, loops, and user input.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** The computer generates a random number within a user-defined range.
- **User Input:** Players can input their guesses and receive feedback.
- **Game Loop:** The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
- **Error Handling:** The program handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Customizable:** Choose the range of numbers to make the game more interesting.

## Getting Started

3. Run the game using the following command:

    python guess_the_number.py


## How to Play

Enter the lower and upper limits for the number range.
